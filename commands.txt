--cors--
A Django App that adds Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers to responses. 
This allows in-browser requests to your Django application from other origins.

Like there is two domain name - abc.com and efg.com
now abc.com want to get some data from efg.com so Here we user CORS
These domain names are also called origins.

CORS can used to specify wich domain will be allowed to shared data or all domins are allowed to share data.

So first abc.com make requests to efg.com and then efg.com verify that is a valid domian name to share data,
once the efg.com validate the request, it send addition http headers to the abc.com and then abc.com send actual
request with help of that http headers.
